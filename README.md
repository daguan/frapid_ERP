# Frapid Framework

Thank you for visiting frapid github repository. Frapid is open source application development
framework released under **MIT License**.


# Introduction

Frapid is a multi-tenant application development framework with a basic
built-in CMS (content management system) functionality. Although frapid can be used 
to build website, it can do a way much more than that.


# Modules & Applications

Frapid provides you bells and whistles to start building your own application (module).
Any frapid application may target any or all of the following scopes:

* Website (Anonymous. Example: Content, Gallery, Blog, Job Listing, etc.)
* Website (Users. Example: Discussion Boards, QnA Site, etc.)
* Backend (Users & Employees. Example: CRM, HRM, ERP, or any other business application)

# Multi Tenancy Concept & Conventions

Frapid was built from the ground up for the cloud. Not only frapid supports web farm environments, 
frapid can also host several (hundred) website and application instances 
running as a single IIS Website.
